# CensusData_Project

The PythonExcel.py project analyzed the census data from a Windows Excel Spreadsheet, and compares the census data to the labor forces in each city of Massachusettes. The Project then prints out a string of each city, population size, how many citizens in the workforce, and how many citizens not in the work force.

MAEmploymentData.xlsx and massachusettes_population_1980-2010.xlsx files must be in the same directory as the PythonExcel.py file.
